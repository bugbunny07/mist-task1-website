  <h1>A day in my life</h1>
  <p><i>Posted on September 29, 2025</i></p>
<p>Today was a really good day! I woke up early, had some coffee, and then sat down to practice coding. I’ve been spending more time learning how websites work, and each day feels like I’m unlocking a new puzzle.</p>

<p>In the morning, I went through some tutorials on HTML. I practiced writing simple structures like headers, paragraphs, and links. Later, I experimented with CSS to make things look nicer. It’s so satisfying to see colors, layouts, and fonts change instantly when I adjust my code.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I took a short walk outside and thought about how far technology has come. It’s crazy to think that something I build here on my laptop could be shared with anyone around the world. That thought alone keeps me motivated to keep learning.</p>

<p>I ended the day by working on this blog project. It might look simple now, but for me, it’s proof that I’ve started building something on my own. I’m excited to keep going and see where this journey takes me!</p>
