  <h1>My First Blog Post</h1>
  <p><i>Posted on September 27, 2025</i></p>
  <p>Hi everyone! This is my very first blog post and I’m so excited to begin this journey. I’ve always wanted a space where I could share my thoughts, experiences, and things I’m learning along the way. Creating this blog is the first step in that direction.</p>
  <p>Right now, I’m focusing on learning web development. I just started with HTML and CSS, and it’s amazing how a few lines of code can bring a page to life. Writing this blog in code feels a little surreal, but also very fun.</p>
  <p>In this space, I’ll be sharing updates about my learning, little projects I’m working on, and maybe even some everyday thoughts about life. I hope to look back on these posts one day and see how much progress I’ve made.</p>
  <p>Thanks for reading my very first post! This feels like the beginning of something new and exciting.</p>
