    <p class="mb-4">Today was one of those days that reminded me why I love learning something new every day. I spent most of my time experimenting with HTML and CSS to create my very own personal website.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">I started the day by revising how to structure a webpage using <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> containers and how CSS can control spacing, colors, and fonts. I also discovered how satisfying it is to use <em>Tailwind CSS</em> to build clean designs quickly!</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Later, I took a walk outside and realized how similar web development feels to art — it’s all about creativity and structure. Each line of code feels like a brushstroke that shapes something beautiful.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">I ended the day feeling productive and inspired to keep coding. Tomorrow, I want to try adding images and maybe a small gallery section!</p>
